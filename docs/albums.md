# What is this page?
Good question! This page is for some of my favorite albums that I listen to. I have separated it by artist then their albums. I like to listen to a albums from a single artist then stack them up in my head. So this is kind of like a visualization how I sort of think about things!

# Beastie Boys
## License To Ill

This is the first album that I would say really got me into music as I am today. The Beastie Boys are my favorite band even to this day. Combining rock and rap with many other musical elements the Beastie Boys have never been a boring band in my opinion, I'd say almost every single one of their songs I have vibed with in a sense. Licensed To Ill was their first album and honest it delivers. 

# The Weekend 
## Beauty Behind The Madness
